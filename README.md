# DATA_CLEANING_TASK1
AI&amp;ML ELEVATE LAB TASK1-DATA CLEANING AND PROCESSING
This project is Task 1 of a machine learning course and focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing using the Titanic dataset. The primary goal is to prepare the dataset for model training by addressing common data quality issues. The raw Titanic data includes details of 891 passengers, such as age, fare, class, gender, and whether or not they survived. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the dataset was systematically cleaned. First, irrelevant or sparsely populated columns such as PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin were removed. Missing values in the Age column were filled using the median, and missing Embarked values were filled using the mode. Categorical features like Sex and Embarked were converted into numerical form using label encoding. Outliers were identified and removed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method for columns including Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch. Then, StandardScaler was applied to normalize these numerical features. A boxplot visualization helped confirm the effect of outlier removal. The final output is a cleaned dataset with 577 rows, free of missing values and outliers, with all features standardized and encoded. This dataset is now ready for the next steps in the machine learning pipeline. The preprocessing script is modular and can be reused or adapted for other datasets with similar issues.
